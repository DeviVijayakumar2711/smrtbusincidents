I would like to report an incident involving your driver of double decker Bus 176 on 6 April 2024 at 5:49pm for negligent driving.

I had boarded at Aft Hillview Station bus stop and alighted at Opp Hillbrooks bus stop.

I was descending the steps from the top deck to the lower deck to alight from the bus when said driver accelerated and braked suddenly.
This caused me to pitch forward, falling down the flight of steps. Two other passengers were kind enough to help me to my feet, at the bottom of the stairs. My right ankle was hurting and my lower left back was in pain. I had to hobble off the bus without any assistance. The driver offered no indication of regret for the injury he had caused.
Even when I had voiced out that he had slammed his brakes suddenly causing me to fall down the stairs.

I hope that this matter will be looked into seriously so that this incident won’t be repeated with other passengers, much less senior citizens.

Hope you can provide me an update on this issue. ",2024-04-16 00:00:00.0000000,2024-06-04 00:00:00.0000000,CLOSED,NULL,2025-04-21 06:32:16.1496610,2024

 We flagged down bus 901. The bus captain saw us with the stroller with our 16-month-old baby in it and he opened the rear door for us to board. While my husband was pushing the stroller onto the bus, the rear door abruptly closed, trapping the stroller between the door panels. My husband and I shouted to alert the bus captain, who then reopened the door.

 The bus captain initially claimed that the door had closed automatically, but after further probing, he admitted his mistake and apologised. He drove on without checking if our child was hurt. Fortunately, our child was unharmed. I would think our baby would have been injured if her head or her hands happened to be sticking out of the stroller at that time!

 My husband and I are utterly shocked and angered by this incident, especially since it is not the first occurrence. A similar incident took place on 14 March 2024. It involved the same bus 901 (number plate 155Y). SMRT responded to our previous complaint (Ref: 2403-02963-01) with an apology and informed us that the bus captain involved would be disciplined. Given that this has happened again a few months later, we want to highlight the severity of the matter. We will not hesitate to notify the higher management and relevant authorities if it is not resolved appropriately.

 Due to the repetitive nature of these incidents, we will not be pacified with a mere apology. We seek monetary compensation for the psychological distress caused to our child, my husband, and myself. Having experienced two such incidents within a span of a few months, my husband and I have developed anxiety and fear of traveling on SMRT buses with our child in the stroller. Yet it is one of the essential modes of transport for us as we do not own a car.

 We urge you to address this matter with utmost seriousness and take immediate action to prevent any further incidents. Specifically, I suggest that SMRT review and enhance the training provided to bus captains, focusing on the safety of passengers boarding and alighting from buses, whether from the front or rear doors. Additionally, implementing stricter consequences for bus captains who demonstrate negligence in this area would encourage greater caution and mindfulness in ensuring passenger safety.

 We certainly do not wish to see another incident similar to the one which happened in August 2023 whereby an elderly women fell and fractured her spine when the bus rear door abruptly closed on her.

 Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

 Note - I am not sure if the above fare card was the one I used that day. If it is not, kindly contact me and I can provide another card number.

At 8:00 AM, my mother was on the way to work at the airport and boarded the Bus 110 from Bus Stop No: 67599, traveling on bus plate number SMB 1321C. Due to the bus being crowded, she had to remain standing. At approximately 8:10 AM, while heading towards the Bus Stop No: 65199, the bus driver abruptly engaged the emergency brake, causing my mother to fall.

My mother has a medical history of Prolapsed Disc, and the fall aggravated her condition. She immediately experienced pain in both her knees and back, resulting in significant pain. We had to seek medical attention at the hospital following this incident.

What is particularly upsetting is that the bus driver showed no initiative to assist my mother after the fall. He neither apologized nor showed any concern for her well-being. He displayed an unprofessional and dismissive attitude throughout the situation. His lack of care and accountability is deeply troubling, and reflecting poorly on the professionalism expected especially from a bus captain representing your company. His actions may jeopardise your company's reputation.

I request an immediate investigation into this matter, as this is not only a safety concern but also a failure of basic courtesy and responsibility. I expect a follow-up from SMRT Corporationregarding this issue and would like to know the actions being taken to address both the driver’s conduct and the broader safety measures in place to prevent such incidents in the future.

Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated.

While I’m standing with my girl (Holding her hand) and waiting for the door to open and alight, the bus give a sudden jerk and I fell onto my back together with my girl.

Even when I was already holding tightly to the rails together with my girl but I’m not able to balance. At that moment, my girl fell and sat on the floor, I lost my balance and hit my buttocks against the steps.

After falling on the floor and hitting against the steps, I could immediately feel the pain directly over the coccyx and I quickly went to see the doctor to review my injury.

Throughout this incident, the bus driver did not show any reactions and it was as if nothing had happened.

I would urge you to take immediate action to address this issue and would appreciate it if you could inform me of the steps taken to rectify this situation and ensure the safety of passengers.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take appropriate action to uphold the safety standards of your company.

Last 25 Jan 2024, I board the bus service # 960 from Rochor station to Little India station. During this time it is heavy traffic along Rochor as the procession for Thaipusam is on the way. I noticed that the driver seems in haste to pass through along the bus lane.He keep pressing the horn. Suddenly the driver pressed the break resulting me to be thrown from the exit door (where I am standing) to near the driver's door. And another passenger falling on top of me. I feel dizzy after that I cannot get up immediately. The driver claimed someone pass cut through infront oh him that why he need to stop. The lady who fell on top of me, mentioned that need to report. The driver offered to bring me to the hospital, but I am still in dazed and told I am ok.I alight at Little India with the help of my colleague to board another bus going to our workplace.The whole morning left side of my body is aching. Comes afternoon that I felt feverish and left side of body felt my numb. i went to SGH AE to be examined. The incident sustained injuries in the right arm superficial scratch wounds that turns blue black and painful after few days, and contusion over left neck, left back and left chest. Though all the diagnostic test turns out not life threatening I believe my fall and that of elderly passenger can be prevented if the driver shown patience and not in hurry to drive.

She proceeded to Woodlands Bus Interchange and boarded Bus Service 960 to travel home. Upon reaching her designated bus stop at Blk 347, she pressed the bell to indicate her intention to alight. When the bus came to a stop, she prepared to exit. However, as she was about to step off the bus, it suddenly moved forward. Due to the sudden motion, she lost her balance and fell inside the bus. Two fellow commuters and the bus driver assisted her in getting up. At that moment, she declined an ambulance as she was still able to stand and walk, albeit slowly. However, over the next few hours, her condition deteriorated, and she began experiencing severe pain in her wrist and leg. Consequently, she was taken to the Woodlands Health Campus Accident  Emergency (AE) Department for medical evaluation. At the hospital, she underwent medical examinations, including X-rays, which revealed that she had sustained an ulnar fracture, along with knee contusion and swelling. Action Taken: • Two commuters and the bus driver assisted my mother after the fall. • She initially refused medical assistance at the scene but was later taken to the hospital due to worsening pain. • She underwent medical examinations at Woodlands Health Campus, where her injuries were diagnosed. (Please see files attached) Request for Follow-up: Given the circumstances, we would like to request a review of the incident, particularly the sudden movement of the bus while a passenger was in the process of alighting. Additionally, we seek any necessary action to ensure passenger safety and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response.

To whom it may concern. 

I take bus 192 daily from 991 Upper Jurong Road at 0640hrs with my 3 years old son and 18 months daughter.

In carrying 3 bags ontop of 2 children.

I used to bring stroller along but i realised that bus driver doesn't even bother to help me .

I have to knock on the back door and struggle to move my stroller up the bus.

Nowsaday since no driver able to help.

I decided not to bring stroller but hand carry all my items.

I decided that bus driver are just selfish and drive fast because they want to complete their task.

This Morning. 26/02/25.

When i board the bus, the driver did not even bother to wait for us to sit down on the chair before moving off.

My 3 years old son fell on the steps.

He didn't even bother to stop the bus but continue to drive off fast before i manage to help my son to get up.

Is the passenger that helps me carry my son to the chair as im carrying my 18 months daughter!!!!!!!!

Throughout the journey, he drove so fast and just cut lane like nobody business.

Before reaching a traffic light he did not slow down the bus but hon at the front truck to ask him move as is green light.

This attitude is unacceptable.

Im fine if you refused to help.

But for my children safety, i expect a full reasonable answer from you all.

I'm writing to you to bring awareness on my unpleasantness during my ride with Bus 903 yesterday. As usual, Bus 903 is always so crowded during the peak hours/season. My 5 yrs old son had a fall from the bus door entrance due to your driver negligence. While we were still making our way to squeeze through the crowd to the door, the door was about to close when my son already at the rear. Despite that, my child had a shocked and lost his balance and fell from the bus. Thanksfully, my son did not fell on his head. He suffered some scratches on his knee and bruises on the side of his face. This is a very unplesaant experience, and it was not my first time encountering such similar incident. Please tell me how can this be improved and such incident can be avoided? And how is SMRT going to be responsible on this incident?

Briefly, on 27 March 2025 at about 3.30pm I was travelling on service 950 from Singapore checkpoint to Woodland terminal.

Within the terminal compound, the bus took a sharp turn at a speed that I fell off the priority seat along with my helper.I suffered a cut on my right hand and my helper on her right cheek. Four passengers helped me to get up and guided me to the passenger lift. A few other passengers were telling the driver of the accident. The driver did not try to investigate or offer assistance.
The passengers who helped me asked me to make a report to the station office as one of them
noticed a blood stain on my white jacket.
On reaching home I cleaned the wound with antiseptic solution and applied iodine. All these time
I felt a tingling sensation and could not sleep well until I went to a clinic on 1 April, 2005 for
treatment of the swollen wound. I am now recovering well. 
I enclose copies of the injury, the medication list and the medical bill for S$63.08 your reference.
My helper do not need treatment.
I am 77 years old with diabetic condition, retired.

As the bus moved off from Opp Bt Batok Driving Ctr bus stop, I moved to the alighting door area awaiting to alight at Opp Home Team NS bus stop. The Bus suddenly made a sharp 90-degree turn from Bukit Batok West Ave 5 to Bukit Batok West Ave 7, a Personal Mobility Aid (PMA) that was facing the opposite window, suddenly moved backwards and crashed towards the alighting door area where I was standing. The lady who was on the PMA, flew off and fell to the floor. I was stuck between the door and the immovable PMA. The bus then slowed down and drove at a slower pace while it was trying to reach the Opp Home Team NS bus stop. Some members of the public wanted to lift the lady up from the floor but many of them commented to let the bus driver handle the situation. Once the bus reached the bus stop, the bus driver walked towards the lady and helped her up. I was then managed to stand up and alight. After a few hours, I felt pain in my lower back area. Above was what happened. My feedback below. Please investigate why and how this incident happened and get back to me. 1. The PMA should be locked and not be parked where the user's back is opposite the alighting area. User's PMA should be facing either the alighting area or parked at least horizontally facing the passengers at the rear area. This will then prevent this incident from happening. 2. Why was there a sharp 90 degree turn out of no where? 3. I was stuck between the door and the immovable PMA but no one help me up. 4. I was shocked after this incident. I fell sick and took a 5 day MC.

Unfortunately, I do not have a footage of the incident. However, I believe that all SMRT buses are equipped with a camera that could have captured the incident.

I was on my way to Winston Oh Hearing at West Coast for my hearing aid appointment.
As I was moving to the rear of the bus, the bus moved off and accelerated before I was seated. As a result, I lost my balance and fell and hit one of the parallel seats on my left and fractured three(3)of my left ribs.
One of the lady passenger managed to alert the bus driver. The driver came and assisted me and asked if I had any pain etc.
When I alighted at Jurong East, the driver said sorry to me and said he did not realise that I fell.
Feeling excruciating pain on the next day, 27th June 2024, I went to Bukit Panjang Polyclinic. The doctor confirmed that three (3) of my left ribs were fractured upon x-ray report(Annex 2). After that I went to Ng Teng Fong Hospital and was warded for 2 days.
Due to the above incident, I am claiming for special and general damages due to the negligence of the driver for not exercising reasonable skills and prudence. The partial photograph of the driver and bus registration number SG5140J, the date and approximate time is attached (Annex 1).
The following are my claims:-
a. Special Damages
1. Bukit Panjang Polyclinic Medical expenses ( Annex 3)      $ 24.592. Ng Teng Fong Hospital Medical expenses                $722.54
  (base on Interim Invoice) (Annex 4)
3.Transportation (Taxi, MRT and bus) expenses(estimate)     $ 20.00
4. Future medical and transport expenses
b. General Damages 5. Pain and Suffering – 3 left ribs fractured                 $30000
 (base on Singapore Academy of Law's Motor Accident
 Claim Online Quantum simulator for fractured ribs) (Annex 5)
 INTERIM CLAIM AMOUNT:                           $3,767.13
The above interim amount is not the final claim amount.
I will inform you of the final claim amount once I receive the Final Invoice from Ng Teng Fong Hospital as it might take several weeks.
I sincerely believe that the above claim amount is fair and reasonable for such a serious injury which I had sustained.
Kindly take steps to ensure that the CCTV footage in respect of this incident is preserved.
Kindly let me have your reply as soon as possible.
Thank you very much.

Below are the details of the incident:

Date/Time of Incident: Approximately 5:50 PM, near Holland Village, on 21 Nov.

Boarding Point: Block 289D.

Details of Incident:

The bus braked heavily three times during the journey. One major stop occurred around 6:20 PM, during which a passenger seated opposite the caller’s wife collided with her.
The passenger, described as a tall Chinese lady with a Chinese accent, wearing spectacles, hit the caller’s wife on her face with her shoulder. This caused damage to the wife’s spectacles, along with a cut and a red bump below her left eye.
The wife experienced pain due to the impact. The same passenger made contact with the wife a second time during another heavy brake, but the wife managed to shift to avoid further injury.
The wife obtained the passenger’s contact details, and the individual agreed to discuss compensation. However, when contacted at the agreed time of 10:00 PM, the caller and his wife tried multiple times over 30 minutes to reach her but received no response. The passenger also provided an address, which, upon verification, was found to be invalid. The caller and his wife believe the incident occurred due to negligence on the part of the Bus Captain and hope to pursue the matter further with SMRT.

During boarding, as I was bringing my market trolley onto the bus, the driver unexpectedly closed the door before my trolley had fully entered the bus. This resulted in the door crushing my trolley. Upon returning home, I discovered that one of the wheels had detached, with a part of it coming off and dropped either in the bus or on the road when I walked back home, rendering the wheel unusable and making the trolley no longer functional. This incident has caused me both inconvenience and financial loss.

NATURE OF INCIDENT

Bus driver throughout journey kept braking, jerking every now  then.

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I hope this email finds you well. My name is Diana Yap, and I am writing to bring to your attention an extremely unsatisfactory experience I recently had with your transportation services. I believe it is crucial to address this matter promptly and seek resolution.

 On 28 May 2024, I utilized your bus transportation service for the journey back home. Unfortunately, the experience was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share my concerns with you.

 I boarded bus 188 on 28 May Tuesday at 9.47pm from the bus stop at Bukit Batok HomeTeamNS. I alighted at the bus stop opposite Southview LRT and transferred to bus 300 at 9.58pm. I alighted at my house's bus stop Choa Chu Kang Avenue 3 at 10.02pm.

 My unsatisfactory experience was on the bus journey onboard bus 300 from 9.58pm-10.02pm. I was standing near the wheelchair seat area. I noticed the bus driver was driving too fast. The bus driver applied brakes suddenly at a traffic light near Sunshine Place to avoid a car stopping infront as it was red light. The sudden jerked caused me to lose my balance, and swayed from front to back. As a result I bumped back and hit my back. The driver did not check on the passengers and continued to move on after the traffic light turned green.

 This incident caused a significant impact on my health, causing my back to be swollen and lower waist pain, walking is very painful for me. As a regular user of your transportation services, I am disheartened by this experience and concerned about the overall quality of the service. I noticed bus drivers will drive faster at night. These drivers have a habit of dashing on the straights and jam brakes at approaching bus stops, and at times with standing passengers tripping, or seated passengers slamming against the back of the seats.

 I understand that bus drivers have a schedule to meet, and I respect the work and effort of these drivers. But I feel that passenger safety is of the utmost importance.

 I kindly request a thorough investigation into the matter and take the necessary steps to address these concerns promptly. I have attached my medical report for your reference. I am open to discussing this further over the phone at a time that is convenient for you. I can be contacted at 9678 9599.

 Thank you.

 Sincerely,
 Diana Yap

I was a passenger on bus 960 on March 19,2025. I and my husband took the bus at Stevens Stn Exit 1 some time around 10:45pm. The bus captain suddenly had sudden break and I hit my sternum on the metal where we tap cards as we were standing. I didn't go see a doctor right after because I was just fine even it was painful. Had a bit of bleeding on my lips though.

I observed a few days but it raised me a concern today since it's still painful when carrying things and having hiccups or a deep breathe and I decided to see a doctor.

Attached are the photo for the bus number, receipts and stand by X-ray request just in case the pain won't go away after 2 weeks.

Regards,
Rhodora Ramos

While the other passengers were walking towards the middle of the bus, the driver started to drive. Before I can sit down, the driver jammed brake and I fell down. A passenger was shouting and asking if I’m okay but the driver didn’t seem to notice and continued driving. I’m sure there is a SOP for SMRT drivers to make sure all passengers were properly seated or stand before driving out of the bus stop. Because of the fall, my left elbow, right elbow, right arm, right back and bone above right buttocks feel sore now. If the soreness persists, I will go and consult a doctor. Please see the CCTV on the bus and give me a reply on how you are going to address this.

As caller was stuck in the traffice queue and happened to be in the yellow box, BC of that Bus SVC 176 was honking non-stop at caller.
It did not took more than 3mins for caller to move out of the situation eventually when the cars in the queue she stuck in started moving.
Once caller managed to move forward a bit further from the yellow box which left a space just nice for Bus 176 to make the turn, BC made the turn at high speed and knocked into caller's car right back bumper.
Caller Mdm. Tan was left in shock and upset at the same time as she heard her vehicle was hit by the bus and BC did not come out to check at all. 
Mdm. Tan is furious about this as the hitting sound was quite loud hence she is sure that BC could've realized that too. 
Mdm. Tan requests an outcome of the investigation.

I cried out in pain but no one came to help. I sat down. I kept moving my foot and realised that I did not break my leg but it was still hurting. When I reached Segar Road, I decided to get off the bus as my left leg was in so much pain. I almost fell down a few times going down the staircase as there was no support from my swollen left leg. Two passengers downstairs asked me if I was alright and asked me to sit down but I couldn't. I asked a lady passenger to help me get off the bus as I needed to go the hospital. The bus driver saw me in pain but did not talk to me. I managed to take a picture of the bus when I alighted at 10.09pm but my hands were shaking and the bus licence number was not clear. Please check your cctv. I was wearing a yellow blouse and blue crop pants and sneakers. At the AE at NTF hospital, the doctor said I had a contusion on my knee and gave me 5 days m.c. with an appointment to see an orthopaedic surgeon on Wednesday December 11. I wish to make an insurance claim for my injury. Please let me know how I can go about it. Thank you.

She grabbed the seat handle for support as her umbrella fell to the floor and immediately experienced severe pain and numbness in her leg. Despite her pain, she managed to alight at the Perumal Temple bus stop with the help of a fellow passenger.
Once she alighted, she sat down but soon realized she could not use her injured leg. Struggling to move on one leg, she was assisted by temple visitors who performed basic medical checks and called an ambulance for her.

I was dazed and by that time my head had started throbbing and a swell the size of a golf ball appeared on the left side of my head. I also had abrasions on my left forearm and pain in my left backside. I felt unwell but I managed to see a doctor at the polyclinic nearby. He told me to monitor myself for any giddiness and severe headaches which I would then have to go to the hospital emergency.

During my journey, I pressed the bell to indicate that I wanted to alight at my stop. Prior to reaching the stop, I stood up, walked along the aisle, and pressed the bell again to ensure my request was registered. I then proceeded to the lower deck to prepare to alight. However, when the bus arrived at my stop, it only paused briefly before the driver abruptly stepped on the accelerator, moving off from the stop. This sudden movement caused me to trip on the stairs, resulting in a fall that caused my left hip to crash against the handle. Realizing the bus had moved off, I immediately approached the driver to inform him that I had pressed the bell and needed to alight. Instead of addressing the situation professionally, the driver looked at me angrily and opened the back door without communicating this to me. I stood waiting at the front door, unaware the back door had been opened, until I noticed it myself. As I made my way to the back door to alight, I heard the driver hurling rude remarks in Chinese. This kind of behavior is entirely unacceptable and uncalled for. As a regular passenger on Bus 190 for this route, I have never encountered such an incident before. I am deeply upset by the driver’s lack of professionalism and courtesy, especially considering his role in providing public service. Furthermore, the fall caused by the sudden acceleration has aggravated a pre-existing injury to my left hip. I intend to file an insurance claim to address this injury and request that the company take responsibility for the incident. I strongly urge you to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate disciplinary action against the driver. He must be reprimanded and trained on proper manners and professional conduct when dealing with passengers. Passengers should feel safe and respected during their journey, and this incident has severely undermined that trust. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and update me on the actions taken to address this issue. Thank you.

I used my Citibank cc to scan in. I alighted at NTU north spine admin building. 

I boarded the double decker bus from the bus stop opposite westwood secondary. Upon reaching the 2nd to top stair landing, the bus started to move. This is when I lost my balance and hurt my right foot. The pain was excruciating as I think I’ve twisted it somehow due to the sudden jerk of the bus. 

I have been to the clinic to seek treatment and was given a bandage and medication as well as MC for yesterday. (Written on 24 Jan).

Update: I just went to the clinic for a review, doctor shared that based on the xray I was diagnosed with undisplaced fracture and is required to go to the hospital.

I am seeking SMRT to look into this matter and give me a response.
